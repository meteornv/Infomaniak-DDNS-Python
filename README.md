# Infomaniak Dynamic DNS via HTTP POST request

This code is for those of you who are just like me: a simple guy juste trying to make infomaniak ddns work automatically.
I already did a repository of this in Nodejs but it's more accessible using python so here it is.

There is two version of the code:
- One with UI
- One without UI

To get started you will need the python module request. You can install by typing:
```
pip install requests
```
